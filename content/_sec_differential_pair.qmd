# Differential Pair {#sec-diff-pair}

Like the current mirror in @sec-current-mirror the **differential pair** is an ubiquitous building block often used in integrated circuit design [@Blumlein_1937]. The fundamental structure is given in @fig-differential-pair.

In order to understand its operation it is instructive to separate the input condition into (1) a purely differential voltage, and (2) a common-mode voltage, and see what the impact on the output currents is.

## Differential Operation of the Diffpair

For a differential mode of operation we assume that the input common mode voltage is constant, i.e., $(V_\mathrm{in,p} + V_\mathrm{in,n})/2 = V_\mathrm{CM}$. The differential input voltage $v_\mathrm{in} = V_\mathrm{in,p} - V_\mathrm{in,n}$, so that
$$
V_\mathrm{in,p} = V_\mathrm{CM} + \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2}
$$
and
$$
V_\mathrm{in,n} = V_\mathrm{CM} - \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2}.
$$

For a small-signal differential drive the potential at the tail point stays constant and we can treat it as a virtual ground. The output current on each side is then given by (neglecting $\gds$ and $\gmb$ of $M_1$ and $M_2$)
$$
i_\mathrm{out,p} = \gm[1] \left( \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2} \right)
$$
and
$$
i_\mathrm{out,n} = \gm[2] \left( -\frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2} \right).
$$

Usually we assume symmetry in the differential pair, so $\gm[1] = \gm[2] = \gm$. The differential output current $i_\mathrm{out}$ is then given by
$$
i_\mathrm{out} = i_\mathrm{out,p} - i_\mathrm{out,n} = \gm v_\mathrm{in}
$$ {#eq-differential-pair-dm}

We see in @eq-differential-pair-dm that the differential output current is simply the differential input voltage multiplied by the $\gm$ of the individual transistor. We also note that the bottom conductance $g_\mathrm{tail}$ plays no role for the small-signal differential operation.

## Common-Mode Operation of the Diffpair

Usually, the source conductance $g_\mathrm{tail}$ is realized by a current source and ideally should be $g_\mathrm{tail} = 0$. If this is the case, then the output currents are not a function of the common-mode input voltage ($I_\mathrm{tail}$ is set by the tail current source), and
$$
I_\mathrm{out,p} = I_\mathrm{out,n} = \frac{I_\mathrm{tail}}{2}.
$$

However, if we assume a realistic tail current source then $g_\mathrm{tail} > 0$. For analysis we can simply look at a half circuit since the circuit operation is symmetric. In order to simplify the analysis a bit we remove all capacitors from the MOSFET small-signal model and set $\gds = \gmb = 0$. We then arrive at the small-signal equivalent circuit shown in @fig-differential-pair-cm (note that we set $v_\mathrm{in,p} = v_\mathrm{in,n} = v_\mathrm{in}$ and $i_\mathrm{out,p} = i_\mathrm{out,n} = i_\mathrm{out}$ under symmetry considerations).

Formulating KVL for the input-side loop we get
$$
v_\mathrm{in} = \vgs + \frac{\id}{g_\mathrm{tail}}.
$$

With $i_\mathrm{out} = \id = \gm \vgs$ we arrive at
$$
i_\mathrm{out} = \frac{\gm g_\mathrm{tail}}{\gm + g_\mathrm{tail}} v_\mathrm{in}
$$ {#eq-differential-pair-cm}

Interpreting @eq-differential-pair-cm we can distinguish the following extreme cases:

1. If $g_\mathrm{tail} = 0$ (ideal tail current source) then $i_\mathrm{out} = 0$, the common-mode voltage variation from the input is suppressed and does not show up at the common-mode output current (which is constant due to the ideal tail current source). This is usually the case that we want to achieve.
2. If $g_\mathrm{tail} \rightarrow \infty$ then $i_\mathrm{out} = \gm v_\mathrm{in}$, which means the output current is a function of the MOSFET $\gm$. If everything is perfectly matched, then the differential output current is zero, but the common-mode output current changes according to the common-mode input voltage. In special cases this can be a wanted behavior, this configuration is called a "pseudo-differential pair."
3. For the typical case that $\gm \gg g_\mathrm{tail}$ then $i_\mathrm{out} \approx g_\mathrm{tail} v_\mathrm{in}$.

Note that the result of @eq-differential-pair-cm is also valid for the general case of a degenerated common-source transistor stage (see @fig-common-source-degenerated). The effective transconductange $\gm'$ is given by ($R_\mathrm{degen} = g_\mathrm{tail}^{-1}$)

$$
\gm' = \frac{i_\mathrm{out}}{v_\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\gm g_\mathrm{tail}}{\gm + g_\mathrm{tail}} = \frac{1}{\gm^{-1} + R_\mathrm{degen}}.
$$

When no degeneration resistor is used, then $\gm' = \gm$. If a degeneration of $R_\mathrm{degen} \gg \gm^{-1}$ is used then $\gm' = 1 / R_\mathrm{degen}$. This result is worth memorizing.
