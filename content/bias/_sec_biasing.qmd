# Biasing

So far, we have pushed one unresolved issue in front of us. We have studied ways to multiply and scale bias currents using current mirrors (see @sec-current-mirror) and we have also found ways to buffer (and scale) bias voltages (see @sec-voltage-buffer-with-ota, scaling can be readily achieved by using a resistive divider in the feedback path). We can generate bias voltages by running a current through a resistor. However, what has not been discussed so far is **how to generate one stable bias current in the first place**.

If we would have a stable reference voltage, then we can use the arrangement shown in @fig-bias-current-gen to generate a bias current that is given by (note the use of feedback using an error amplifier which could be a simple OTA)

$$
I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{V_\mathrm{ref}}{R_1}.
$$

Using $A_1$ and $M_1$ the voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ is regulated across $R_1$ and available at the drain of $M_1$.

{{< include /content/bias/_fig_bias_current_gen.qmd >}}

The resistor $R_1$ will show variation with the process tolerance, but we can either (a) use an external resistor for a precise current generation, or (b) use some sort of trimming to correct this resistor value. Depending on the further use of the bias currents a variation of the resistor might no be a bad thing. Assuming we use the resulting bias current to generate somewhere a bias voltage $V_\mathrm{bias}$ by running the current through resistor $R_2$, then this voltage is given by

$$
V_\mathrm{bias} = R_2 I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{R_2}{R_1} V_\mathrm{ref}.
$$

We can see in the above equation that the absolute values of $R_1$ and $R_2$ do not play a role, only the *ratio* is important. Luckily, components in integrated circuits match very well, so we can multiply and scale one reference voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ across our IC.

Since all components on chip will experience manufacturing tolerances of at least $\pm 10\%$ we strive for something more accurate. We can resort to an off-chip property like an externally provided reference current or voltage, or use the power supply as a voltage reference (often, power supply rails are specified to $\pm 5 \ldots 10\%$).

The only option left is to use a material property of the silicon itself for stable reference voltage generation.

## Bandgap Reference

It has been realized that a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has the wonderful property, that the base-emitter voltage $\VBE$ has the following approximate relationship vs. temperature [@Widlar_1971]

$$
\VBE \approx V_\mathrm{g0} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_0} \right) + \VBE[0] \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)
$$ {#eq-vbe-vs-temp}

where $V_\mathrm{g0} = 1.205\,\text{V}$ is the bandgap voltage of silicon at $0\,\text{K}$ and $\VBE[0]$ is the base-emitter voltage of a BJT as reference temperature $T_0$. Further, the difference in $\VBE$ of two BJT operated at different emitter current densities $J_1$ and $J_2$ is given as

$$
\Delta \VBE = \frac{k T}{q} \ln \left( \frac{J_1}{J_2} \right)
$$ {#eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp}

with $k$ the Boltzmann constant, and $q$ the elementary charge.

Adding @eq-vbe-vs-temp and @eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp results in a reference voltage of value

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} =  V_\mathrm{g0} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_0} \right) + \VBE[0] \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right) +  \frac{k T}{q} \ln \left( \frac{J_1}{J_2} \right)
$$ {#eq-bandgap-voltage-with-temp}

which can be made temperature-insensitive when the terms, which are a function of $T$, cancel each other, and only

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} =  V_\mathrm{g0}
$$ {#eq-bandgap-voltage}

remains. We thus have created an on-chip reference (called the [*bandgap voltage reference*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandgap_voltage_reference)) which is almost independent of manufacturing tolerances with a very small temperature coefficient. Of course, this is only true neglecting second-order effects, but nevertheless, reference accuracies of $\pm 1 \ldots 3\%$ without trimming are perfectly possible.

The original implementation in [@Widlar_1971] uses NPN transistors. The question is, where do we find BJT in a CMOS process? Luckily, when looking at the typical implementations, we find that there is a layer sandwich of P-N-P available. While the PNPs constructed parasitically out of this available layers are available for free without extra processing cost, they are very slow, show unusually small $\beta < 10$, and the collector is tied to $\VSS$ as it is the substrate. Still, for bandgap references, they are very useful.

A simple implementation of a bandgap reference circuit is shown in @fig-bandgap-simple [@Gray_Meyer_5th_ed]. If we scale $R_1$ and $R_2$ correctly then we can achieve @eq-bandgap-voltage. Note that the output voltage is ca. $1.2\,\text{V}$, so operating this circuit on low supply voltages will be problematic.

{{< include /content/bias/_fig_bandgap_reference_simple.qmd >}}

$M_1$ to $M_4$ are scaled in a way that in both branches the same bias current is flowing. Further, $M_1$ and $M_2$ ensure that there is the same potential at their sources. Since the PNP are scaled by the factor $n$ (thus the current density is different) so that the following voltage develops across $R_1$:

$$
\Delta \VBE = \frac{k T}{q} \ln m
$$

Hence, the bias current in all the branches is given by

$$
I_\mathrm{bias} = \frac{\Delta \VBE}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_1} \frac{k T}{q} \ln m. 
$$ {#eq-bandgap-bias-current}

Inspecting @eq-bandgap-bias-current we see that $I_\mathrm{bias} = k_1 T$ is a linear function of temperature $T$, a property that is very useful and called **PTAT** (proportional to absolute temperature). With $M_5$ we mirror this bias current into the output branch, and the output voltage $V_\mathrm{ref}$ is then given by

$$
V_\mathrm{ref} = \VBE + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \frac{k T}{q} \ln m.  
$$

By proper selection of $R_1$, $R_2$ and $m$ we can satisfy @eq-bandgap-voltage-with-temp to result in @eq-bandgap-voltage.

::: {.callout-note title="Improved Bandgap Reference"}
For an improved implementation of @fig-bandgap-simple, the current mirrors should be cascoded, and a startup circuit should be included to guarantee proper operation after enabling it. Further, @eq-vbe-vs-temp and @eq-delta-vbe-vs-temp build on the relationship $I_\mathrm{C} = f(\VBE)$, while we control $I_\mathrm{E}$ in this circuit. If $\beta$ is large then $I_\mathrm{C} \approx I_\mathrm{E}$, but this is not the case for the used PNPs.
:::

The circuit of @fig-bandgap-simple has been implemented in Xschem and is shown in @fig-bandgap-schematic. The current sources have been improved by using cascodes. We are using the low-voltage current mirror type already introduced in @sec-improved-ota. The bias voltages for the cascodes are generated via the voltage drops of $R_3$ and $R_4$, respectively. 

No base current compensation for the BJTs is implemented, as it is assumed that the $\beta$ of the PNP are similar although they are operated at different emitter current densities.

Note the addition of a startup branch with $M_\mathrm{startup}$ which is inactive during normal operation but will inject a startup current if no proper bias point has yet been found.

There is no circuitry added for enabling/disabling the circuit, which would also be needed for a practical implementation. As usual, the MOSFET sizing has been done in this [notebook](sizing/sizing_bandgap_simple.ipynb).

The resistors $R_{1-4}$ have been implemented out of unit elements of ca. $5\,\text{k}\Omega$ for optimum matching. Building a bandgap for the first time on silicon likely will show a slightly deviating temperature coefficient, which is why we keep a few dummy resistors around in $R_2$ to compensate the TC in a redesign.

![Simple bandgap reference circuit in Xschem.](./xschem/bandgap_simple.svg){#fig-bandgap-schematic}

The Xschem schematic is available [here](./xschem/bandgap_simple.sch) and the simulated reference voltage vs. temperature is shown in @fig-bandgap-sim-result. For a typical process we achieve a TC of $\pm 0.2\%$.

#plt.title("Reference Voltage of Bandgap")

```

Please note how tight the dc operating point is in this design to keep all MOSFET saturated. We only use $100\,\text{mV}$ nominally as headroom. The circuit in @fig-bandgap-schematic works only marginally at $\VDD = 1.5\,\text{V}$, but would not work at $1.2\,\text{V}$ or lower. Improved circuit architectures for $<1\,\text{V}$ operation exist [@Banba_1999,@Eberlein_2018].

## Banba Bandgap Reference {#sec-banba-bandgap}

The Banba reference [@Banba_1999] is quite a bit trickier to design than the classical bandgap shown in @fig-bandgap-simple. It requires the use of an error amplifier; luckily, we can use the 5T-OTA which we designed in @sec-basic-ota. Since a loop is involved the startup of this circuit is not easy and requires the use of a transient simulation and a proper pre-charge of critical nodes. We can use the ngspice scripting language to (a) set the temperature for a sweep, (b) run a transient simulation, and (c) capture the final reference voltage and save it.

A first design has been implemented and is shown in @fig-bandgap-banba-schematic, and the testbench is shown in @fig-bandgap-banba-tb. The supply voltage (which could be lower than $1.5\,\text{V}$) is limited by our OTA design; however, it works well at $\VDD = 1.5\,\text{V}$. The simulated reference voltage (which is scaled to roughly $V_\mathrm{bandgap} / 2$) is shown in @fig-bandgap-banba-sim-result.

![Banba bandgap reference circuit in Xschem.](./xschem/bandgap_banba.svg){#fig-bandgap-banba-schematic}

Note the self-biasing of the OTA with the current generated in the reference branches. The feedback loop needs capacitors for stabilization, and we use area-efficient MOSFET for this task. For a detailed explanation of this circuit please refer to [@Banba_1999], but in brief, the operation is as follows:

The CTAT and PTAT currents required for compensating each others TC's are built using a $\Delta \VBE$ cell (given the PTAT current) with parallel resistors (providing the CTAT current). Voltages are sensed using an error amplifier and current sources are controlled to achieve matching currents in both branches. This current can then also be mirrored to flow through another resistor which can be scaled to produce the output voltage.

In comparison to the classical bandgap reference shown in @fig-bandgap-simple (where the developed currents in all branches are PTAT) the currents developed in the Banba reference are constant vs. temperature.

The minimum supply voltage for the Banba reference is the $\VBE$ of the PNP plus the saturation voltage of one MOSFET current source, so ca. $\VDD[min] \ge 0.8\,\text{V} + 0.2\,\text{V} \approx 1\,\text{V}$. Of course we also need to design an OTA which can work at this low supply.

A well described design of a Banba bandgap reference (including a two-stage OTA and a regulated cascode for the output current mirror), covering much more details than discussed here, can be found in [Razavi_2021_bandgap].

::: {.callout-tip title="Exercise: Improved Low-Voltage Bandgap"}
As an *optional* exercise for advanced users: Design a bandgap circuit following [Razavi_2021_bandgap]. Implement the shown two-stage OTA and the regulated cascode.

As a starting point, the design of @sec-banba-bandgap can be used. As this design will contain more blocks, please build up a hierarchical design, with the OTAs designed in separate subcircuits.
