# Appendix: Xschem Cheatsheet {#sec-xschem-cheatsheet}

When opening Xschem, using `Help -> Keys` a pop-up windows comes up with many useful shortcuts. The most useful are:

#### Moving around in a schematic:

- `Cursor keys` to move around
- `Ctrl-e` to go back to parent schematic
- `e` to descend into schematic of selected symbol
- `i` to descend into symbol of selected symbol
- `f` full zoom on schematic
- `Shift-z` to zoom in
- `Ctrl-z` to zoom out

#### Editing schematics:

- `Del` to delete elements
- `Ins` to insert elements from library
- `Escape` to abort an operation
- `Ctrl-#` to rename components with duplicate names
- `c` to copy elements
- `Alt-Shift-l` to add wire label
- `Alt-l` to add label pin
- `m` to move selected objects
- `Shift-R` to rotate selected objects
- `Shift-F` to mirror / flip selected objects
- `q` to edit properties
- `Ctrl-s` to save schematic
- `t` to place a text
- `Shift-T` to toggle the `ignore` flag on an instance
- `u` to undo an operation
- `w` to draw a wire
- `Shift-W` draw wire and snap to close pin or net point
- `&` to join, break, and collapse wires
- `A` to make symbol from schematic
- `Alt-s` to reload the circuit if changes in a subcircuit were made

#### Viewing/Simulating Schematics

- `5` to only view probes
- `k` to highlight selected net
- `Shift-K` to unhighlight all nets
- `Shift-o` to toggle light/dark color scheme
- `s` to run a simulation
- `a & b` to add cursors to an in-circuit simulation graph
- `f` full zoom on y- or x-axis in in-circuit simulation graph
