    "### IHP’s SG13G2 130nm CMOS Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "SG13G2 is the name of a 130nm CMOS technology (strictly speaking BiCMOS) from IHP Microelectronics. It features low-voltage (thin-oxide) core MOSET, high-voltage (thick-oxide) I/O MOSFET, various types of linear resistors, and 7 layers of Aluminium metallization (5 thin, 2 thick metal layers). This PDK is open-source, and the complete process specification can be found at [SG13G2 process specification](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_process_spec.pdf). While we will not do layouts in this course, the layout rules can be found at [SG13G2 layout rules](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_layout_rules.pdf).\n",

    "### Schematic Entry Using Xschem\n",
    "\n",
    "Xschem is an open-source schematic entry tool with emphasis on integrated circuits. For up-to-date information of the many features of Xschem please look at the [online documentation](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/xschem_man/xschem_man.html). Usage of Xschem will be learned with the first few basic examples, essentially a single MOSFET. The usage model of Xschem is that the schematic is hierarchically drawn, and the simulation and evaluation statements are contained in the schematics. Further, Xschem offers embedded graphing, which we will mostly use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Simulation Using ngspice\n",
    "\n",
    "ngspice is an open-source circuit simulator with SPICE dependency. Besides the usual simulated types like `op` (operating point), `dc` (dc sweeps), `tran` (time-domain), or `ac` (for small-signal frquency sweeps), ngspice offers a script-like control interface, where many different simulation controls and result evaluations can be done. For detailed information please refer to the latest [manual](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-43-manual.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated IC Design Environment (IIC-OSIC-TOOLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make usage of the various required components (tools like Xschem, PDK like SG13G2) easier, we will use the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS. This is a pre-setup Docker image which allows to design on a virtual machine on virtually any type of computing equipment. For further information like installed tools, how to setup a VM, etc. please look at [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS GitHub page](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced users can install this image on their personal computer, for JKU students the IIC will host a VM on our compute cluster and provide personal login credentials."
