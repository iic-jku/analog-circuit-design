This is the material for an intermediate-level MOSFET circuit design course, held at JKU under course number 336.009 ("KV Analoge Schaltungstechnik"). Follow this [link](https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design) to access the material.

The course makes heavy use of circuit simulation, using **Xschem** for schematic entry and **ngspice** for simulation. The 130nm CMOS technology **SG13G2** from IHP Microelectronics is used.

Tools and PDK are integrated in the **IIC-OSIC-TOOLS** Docker image, which will be used during the coursework.

All course material is made publicly available and shared under the Apache-2.0 license.
