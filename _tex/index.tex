\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

This is the material for an intermediate-level MOSFET circuit design
course, held at JKU under course number 336.009 (``KV Analoge
Schaltungstechnik'').

The course makes heavy use of circuit simulation, using \textbf{Xschem}
for schematic entry and \textbf{ngspice} for simulation. The 130nm CMOS
technology \textbf{SG13G2} from IHP Microelectronics is used.

Tools and PDK are integrated in the \textbf{IIC-OSIC-TOOLS} Docker
image, which will be used during the coursework.

\subsubsection{IHP's SG13G2 130nm CMOS
Technology}\label{ihps-sg13g2-130nm-cmos-technology}

SG13G2 is the name of a 130nm CMOS technology (strictly speaking BiCMOS)
from IHP Microelectronics. It features low-voltage (thin-oxide) core
MOSFET, high-voltage (thick-oxide) I/O MOSFET, various types of linear
resistors, and 7 layers of Aluminium metallization (5 thin plus 2 thick
metal layers). This PDK is open-source, and the complete process
specification can be found at
\href{https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_process_spec.pdf}{SG13G2
process specification}. While we will not do layouts in this course, the
layout rules can be found at
\href{https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK/blob/main/ihp-sg13g2/libs.doc/doc/SG13G2_os_layout_rules.pdf}{SG13G2
layout rules}.

For our circuit design, the most important parameters of the available
devices are summarized in the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Low-voltage NMOS}: Device \texttt{sg13\_lv\_nmos}; operating
  voltage nominal \(V_\mathrm{DD}=1.5\,\text{V}\),
  \(L_\mathrm{min}=0.13\,\mu\text{m}\),
  \(V_\mathrm{th}\approx 0.5\,\text{V}\); a triple-well option for the
  NMOS is available.
\item
  \textbf{Low-voltage PMOS}: Device \texttt{sg13\_lv\_pmos}; operating
  voltage nominal \(V_\mathrm{DD}=1.5\,\text{V}\),
  \(L_\mathrm{min}=0.13\,\mu\text{m}\),
  \(V_\mathrm{th}\approx -0.47\,\text{V}\).
\item
  \textbf{High-voltage NMOS}: Device \texttt{sg13\_hv\_nmos}; operating
  voltage nominal \(V_\mathrm{DD}=3.3\,\text{V}\),
  \(L_\mathrm{min}=0.45\,\mu\text{m}\),
  \(V_\mathrm{th}\approx 0.7\,\text{V}\); a triple-well option for the
  NMOS is available.
\item
  \textbf{High-voltage PMOS}: Device \texttt{sg13\_hv\_pmos}; operating
  voltage nominal \(V_\mathrm{DD}=3.3\,\text{V}\),
  \(L_\mathrm{min}=0.45\,\mu\text{m}\),
  \(V_\mathrm{th}\approx -0.65\,\text{V}\).
\item
  \textbf{Silicided poly resistor}: Device \texttt{rsil};
  \(R_\square=7\,\Omega \pm 10\%\), \(\text{TC}_1=3100\,\text{ppm/K}\)
\item
  \textbf{Poly resistor}: Device \texttt{rppd};
  \(R_\square=260\,\Omega \pm 10\%\), \(\text{TC}_1=170\,\text{ppm/K}\)
\item
  \textbf{Poly resistor high}: Device \texttt{rhigh};
  \(R_\square=1360\,\Omega \pm 15\%\),
  \(\text{TC}_1=-2300\,\text{ppm/K}\)
\item
  \textbf{MIM capacitor}: Device \texttt{cap\_cmim};
  \(C'=1.5\,\text{fF}/\mu\text{m}^2 \pm 10\%\),
  \(\text{VC}_1=-26\text{ppm/V}\), \(\text{TC}_1=3.6\text{ppm/K}\),
  breakdown voltage \(>15\,\text{V}\)
\item
  \textbf{MOM capacitor}: The metal stack is well-suited for MOM
  capacitors due to 5 thin metal layers, but no primitive capacitor
  device is available at this point.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Schematic Entry Using
Xschem}\label{schematic-entry-using-xschem}

Xschem is an open-source schematic entry tool with emphasis on
integrated circuits. For up-to-date information of the many features of
Xschem and the basic operation of it please look at the available
\href{https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/xschem_man/xschem_man.html}{online
documentation}. Usage of Xschem will be learned with the first few basic
examples, essentially using a single MOSFET. The usage model of Xschem
is that the schematic is hierarchically drawn, and the simulation and
evaluation statements are contained in the schematics. Further, Xschem
offers embedded graphing, which we will mostly use.

\subsubsection{Circuit Simulation Using
ngspice}\label{circuit-simulation-using-ngspice}

ngspice is an open-source circuit simulator with SPICE dependency (Nagel
1975). Besides the usual simulated types like \texttt{op} (operating
point), \texttt{dc} (dc sweeps), \texttt{tran} (time-domain), or
\texttt{ac} (small-signal frquency sweeps), ngspice offers a script-like
control interface, where many different simulation controls and result
evaluations can be done. For detailed information please refer to the
latest
\href{https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-43-manual.pdf}{online
manual}.

\subsubsection{Integrated IC Design Environment
(IIC-OSIC-TOOLS)}\label{integrated-ic-design-environment-iic-osic-tools}

In order to make use of the various required components (tools like
Xschem and ngspice, PDKs like SG13G2) easier, we will use the
\textbf{IIC-OSIC-TOOLS}. This is a pre-compiled Docker image which
allows to do circuit design on a virtual machine on virtually any type
of computing equipment (personal PC, Raspberry Pi, cloud server) on
various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). For further
information like installed tools, how to setup a VM, etc. please look at
\href{https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS}{IIC-OSIC-TOOLS GitHub
page}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Tip}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white]

Please make sure to receive information about your personal VM access
ahead of the course start.

\end{tcolorbox}

Experienced users can install this image on their personal computer, for
JKU students the IIC will host a VM on our compute cluster and provide
personal login credentials.

In this course, we assume that students have a basic knowledge of Linux
and how to operate it using the terminal. If you are not yet familiar
with Linux (which is basically a must when doing integrated circuit
design as many tools are only available on Linux), then please check out
a Linux introductory course or tutorial online, there are many
ressources available.

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{First Steps}\label{sec-first-steps}

In this first chapter we will learn to use Xschem for schematic entry,
and how to operate the ngspice SPICE simulator for circuit simulations.
Further, we will make ourself familiar with the transistor and other
passive components available in the IHP Microelectronics SG13G2
technology. While this is strictly speaking a BiCMOS technology offering
MOSFETs as well as SiGe HBTs, we will use it as a pure CMOS technology.

\subsubsection{The Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor
(MOSFET)}\label{sec-mosfet}

In this course, we will not dive into semiconductor physics and derive
the device operation bottom-up starting from a fundamental level
governed by quantum mechanics. Instead, we will treat the MOSFET as a
macroscopic by assuming we have a 4-terminal device, and the performance
of this device regarding its terminal voltages and currents we will
largely derive from the simulation model.

The circuit symbol that we will use for the n-channel MOSFET is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-nmos-symbol}, and for the p-channel MOSFET it is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-pmos-symbol}. A control voltage between gate (``G'')
and source (``S'') causes a current to flow between drain (``D'') and
source. The MOSFET is a 4-terminal device, so the bulk (``B'') can also
control the drain-source current flow. Often, the bulk is connected to
source, and then the bulk terminal is not shown to declutter the
schematics.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

Strictly speaking is the drain-source current of a MOSFET controlled by
the voltage between gate and bulk and the voltage between drain and
source. Since bulk is often connected to source anyway, and many circuit
designers historically were already familiar with the operation of the
bipolar junction transistor, it is common to consider the gate-source
voltage (besides the drain-source voltage) as the controlling voltage.

This focus on gate-source implies that the source is special compared to
the drain. In a typical physical MOSFET, however, the drain and source
are constructed exactly the same, and which terminal is drain, and which
terminal is source, is only determined by the applied voltage
potentials, and can change dynamically during operation (think of a
MOSFET operating as a switch\ldots{} which side is the drain, which side
is the source?).

Unfortunately, this focus on a ``special'' source has made its way into
some MOSFET compact models. The model that is used in SG13G2 luckily
uses the PSP model, which is formulated symmetrically with regards to
drain and source, and is thus very well suited for analog and RF circuit
design. For a detailed understanding of the PSP model please refer to
the
\href{https://www.nxp.com/wcm_documents/models/mos-models/model-psp/psp102p4_summary.pdf}{model
documentation}.

For hand calculations and theoretical discussions we will use the
following simplified large-signal model, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-large-signal-model}. A current source
\(I_\mathrm{DS}\) models the current flow between drain and source, and
it is controlled by the three control voltages \(V_\mathrm{GS}\),
\(V_\mathrm{DS}\), and \(V_\mathrm{SB}\). Note that in this way (since
\(I_\mathrm{DS}= f(V_\mathrm{DS})\)) also a resistive behavior between D
and S can be modelled. In case that B and S are shorted then simply
\(V_\mathrm{SB} = 0\).

In an ideal MOSFET no dc current is flowing into the gate, the behavior
is purely capacitive. We model this by two capacitors:
\(C_\mathrm{GG}= C_\mathrm{GS}+ C_\mathrm{GD}\) is the total capacitance
when looking into the gate of the MOSFET. \(C_\mathrm{GS}\) is usually
the dominant capacitance, and \(C_\mathrm{GD}\) models the capacitive
feedback between D and G, usually induced by a topological overlap
capacitance in the physical construction of the MOSFET. This capacitance
is often small compared to \(C_\mathrm{GS}\), but in situations where we
have a large voltage swing at the drain this capacitance will be
affected by the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_effect}{Miller effect}. In
hand calculations we will often set \(C_\mathrm{GD}= 0\).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

The bulk connection in Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-large-signal-model} seems
floating as we only consider it a control terminal, where the potential
difference between source and bulk influences the behaviour of the
MOSFET. However, we do not consider resistive or capacitive effects
associated with this node, which is of course a gross simplification,
but nevertheless one we will make in this course.

\end{tcolorbox}

Now, as we are skipping the bottom-up approach of deriving the MOSFET
large-signal behaviour from basic principles, we need to understand the
behaviour of the elements of the large-signal model in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-large-signal-model} by using a circuit simulator
and observing what happens. And generally, a first step in any new IC
technology should be to investigate basic MOSFET performance, by doing
simple dc sweeps of \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) and \(V_\mathrm{DS}\) and looking
at \(I_\mathrm{DS}\) and other large- and small-signal parameters.

As a side note, the students who want to understand MOSFET behaviour
from a physical angle should consult the MOSFET chapter from the JKU
course ``Design of Complex Integrated Circuits'' (VL 336.048). A great
introduction into MOSFET operation and fabrication is given in (Hu
2010), which is available freely
\href{https://www.chu.berkeley.edu/modern-semiconductor-devices-for-integrated-circuits-chenming-calvin-hu-2010/}{online}
and is a recommended read. A very detailed description of the MOSFET
(leaving usually no question unanswered) is provided in (Tsividis and
McAndrew 2011).

Now, in order to get started, basic Xschem testbenches are prepared, and
first simple dc sweeps of various voltages and currents will be done.
But before that, please look at the import note below!

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white]

Throughout this material, we will stick to the following notations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{dc quantity} is shown with an upper-case letter with
  upper-case subscripts, like \(V_\mathrm{GS}\).
\item
  Double-subscripts denote \textbf{dc sources}, like \(V_\mathrm{DD}\)
  and \(V_\mathrm{SS}\).
\item
  An \textbf{ac (small-signal) quantity} is a lower-case letter with a
  lower-case subscript, like \(g_\mathrm{m}\).
\item
  A \textbf{total quantity} (dc plus ac) is shown as a lowercase letter
  with upper-case subscript, like \(i_\mathrm{DS}\).
\item
  A upper-case letter with a lower-case subscript is used to denote
  \textbf{RMS quantities}, like \(I_\mathrm{ds}\).
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Large-Signal MOSFET Model}\label{large-signal-mosfet-model}

We start with an investigation into the large-signal MOSFET model shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-large-signal-model} by using the simple
testbench for the LV NMOS shown in Figure~\ref{fig-simple-nmos-tb}.

\paragraph{Small-Signal MOSFET
Model}\label{sec-mosfet-smallsignal-model}

As you have seen in the previous investigations, the large-signal model
of Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-large-signal-model} describes the behaviour of
the MOSFET across a wide range of voltages applied at the MOSFET
terminals. Unfortunately, for hand analysis dealing with a nonlinear
model is close to impossible, at the very least it is quite tedious.

However, for many practical situations, we bias a MOSFET with a set of
dc voltages applied to its terminal, and only apply small signal
excursions during operation. If we do this, we can linearize the
large-signal model in this dc operating point, and resort to a
small-signal model which can be very useful for hand calculations. Many
experienced designers analyze their circuits by doing these kind of hand
calculations and describing the circuit analytically, which is a great
way to understand fundamental performance limits and relationships
between parameters.

We will use the small-signal MOSFET model shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-small-signal-model} for this course. The
current-source \(i_\mathrm{ds}= g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{gs}\) models the
drain current as a function of \(v_\mathrm{gs}\), and the resistor
\(g_\mathrm{ds}\) models the dependency of the drain current by
\(v_\mathrm{ds}\). The drain current dependency on the source-bulk
voltage (the so-called ``body effect'') is introduced by the current
source \(i_\mathrm{ds}= g_\mathrm{mb} v_\mathrm{sb}\).

As any electronic device the MOSFET introduces noise into the circuit.
In this course we will only consider the drain-source current noise of
the MOSFET, given by
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-noise}{
\overline{I_\mathrm{n}^2} = 4 k T \gamma g_\mathrm{d0},
}\end{equation} where \(\overline{I_\mathrm{n}^2}\) is the
power-spectral density of the noise in A\(^2\)/Hz; \(k\) is the
Boltzmann constant; \(T\) is the absolute temperature; \(\gamma\) is a
parameter in simplified theory changing between \(\gamma = 2/3\) in
saturation and \(\gamma =1\) for triode operation; \(g_\mathrm{d0}\) is
equal to \(g_\mathrm{m}\) in saturation and \(g_\mathrm{ds}\) in
triode).

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

Sometimes we will refer to different operating modes of the MOSFET like
``saturation'' or ``triode''. Generally speaking, when the drain-source
voltage is small, then the MOSFET acts as a resistor, and this mode of
operation we call ``triode'' mode. When the drain-source voltage is
increased, at some point the drain-source current saturates and is no
longer a strong function of the drain-source voltage. This mode is
called ``saturation'' mode. As you can see in the large-signal
investigations, these transitions happen gradually, and it is difficult
to define a precise point where one operating mode switches to the other
one. In this sense we use terms like ``triode'' and ``saturation'' only
in an approximative sense.

\end{tcolorbox}

Now we need to see how the small-signal parameters seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-small-signal-model} can be investigated and
estimated using circuit simulation.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Congratulations for making it thus far! By now you should have a solid
grasp of the tool handling of Xschem and ngspice, and you should be
familiar with the large- and small-signal operation of both NMOS and
PMOS, and the parameters describing these behaviours. If you feel you
are not sufficiently fluent in these things, please go back to the
beginning of Section~\ref{sec-mosfet} and revisit the relevant sections,
or dive into further reading about the MOSFET operation, like in (Hu
2010).

\subsection{Transistor Sizing Using gm/ID
Methodology}\label{sec-gmid-method}

When designing integrated circuits it is an important question how to
select various parameters of a MOSFET, like \(W\), \(L\), or the bias
current \(I_\mathrm{D}\). In comparison to using discrete components in
PCB design, or also compared to a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), we
have these degrees of freedom, which make integrated circuit design so
interesting.

Often, transistor sizing in entry-level courses is based on the
square-law model, where a simple analytical equation for the drain
current can be derived. However, in nanometer CMOS, the MOSFET behaviour
is much more complex than these simple models. Also, this highly
simplified derivations introduce concepts like the threshold voltage or
the overdrive voltage, which are interesting from a theoretical
viewpoint, but bear little practical use.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

One of the many simplifactions of the square-law model is that the
mobility of the charge carriers is assumed constant (it is not).
Further, the existance of a threshold voltage is assumed, but in fact
this voltage is just existing given a certain definition, and depending
on definition, its value changed. In addition, in nm CMOS, the threshold
voltage is a function on many thing, like \(W\) and \(L\).

\end{tcolorbox}

An additional shortcoming of the square-law model is that it is only
valid in strong inversion, i.e.~for large \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) where the
drain current is dominated by the drift current. As soon as the
gate-source voltage gets smaller, the square-law model breaks, as the
drain current component based on diffusion currents gets dominant.
Modern compact MOSFET models (like the PSP model used in SG13G2) use
hundreds of parameters and fairly complex equations to somewhat properly
describe MOSFET behaviour over a wide range of parameters like \(W\),
\(L\), and temperature. A modern approach to MOSFET sizing is thus based
on the thought to use exactly these MOSFET models, characterize them,
put the resulting data into tables and charts, and thus learn about the
complext MOSFET behaviour and use it for MOSFET sizing.

Being a well-established approach we select the
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) methodology introduced by P. Jespers and
B. Murmann in (Jespers and Murmann 2017). A brief introduction is
available
\href{https://github.com/iic-jku/analog-circuit-design/blob/main/sizing/Ref_Murmann_gmID.pdf}{here}
as well.

The \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) methodology has the huge advantage
that is catches MOSFET behavior quite accurately over a wide range of
operating conditions, and the curves look very similar for pretty much
all CMOS technologies, form micrometer bulk CMOS down to nanometer
FinFET devices. Of course the absolute values change, but the method
applies universally.

\subsubsection{MOSFET Characterization
Testbench}\label{mosfet-characterization-testbench}

In order to get the required tabulated data we use a testbench in Xschem
which sweeps the terminal voltages, and records various large- and
small-signal parameters, which are then stored in large tables. The
testbench for the LV NMOS is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-techsweep-nmos-tb}, and the TB for the LV PMOS is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig-techsweep-pmos-tb}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}%

We will use Jupyter notebooks to inspect the resulting data, and
interpret some important graphs. This will greatly help to understand
the MOSFET behaviour.

\subsubsection{NMOS Characterization}\label{sec-techsweep-nmos}

First, we will start looking at the LV NMOS. In
Section~\ref{sec-techsweep-pmos} we have the corresponding graphs for
the LV PMOS. In this lecture, we will only use the LV MOSFETs. While
there are also the HV types available, they are mainly used for
high-voltage circuits, like circuits connecting to the outside world.
Here, we only will design low-voltage circuits running at a nominal
supply voltage of \(1.5\,\text{V}\), so only the LV types are of
interest to us.

The first import graph is the plot of \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and
\(f_\mathrm{T}\) versus the gate-source voltage \(V_\mathrm{GS}\). First
let us answer the question why \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) is a good
parameter to look at, and actually this is also the central parameter in
the \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) methodology. In many circuits that are
biased in class-A (i.e., with a constant quiescent current that is
larger than the largest signal excursion, see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_amplifier_classes\#Class_A}{biasing})
we want to get a large amplification from a MOSFET, which corresponds to
a large \(g_\mathrm{m}\). We want this by spending the minimum biasing
current possible (ideally zero), as we always design for minimum power
consumption. Thus, a high \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) ratio is good.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

Designing for minimum power consumption is pretty much always mandated.
For battery-operated equipment it is a paramount requirement, but also
in other equipment electrical energy consumption is a concern, and often
severly limited by the cooling capabilities of the electrical system.

\end{tcolorbox}

However, as can be seen in the below plot, there exists a strong and
unfortunate trade-off with device speed, characterized here by the
transit frequency \(f_\mathrm{T}\). It would be ideal if there exists a
design point where we get high transconductance per bias current
concurrently to having the fastest operation, but unfortunately, this is
clearly not the case. The \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) peaks for
\(V_\mathrm{GS}< 0.3\,\text{V}\), and the highest speed we get at
\(V_\mathrm{GS}\approx 1.2\,\text{V}\). The dashed vertical line plots
the nominal threshold voltage, as you can see in this continuum of
parameter space, it marks not a particularly special point.

Note that
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-gmid-weakinversion}{
\frac{g_\mathrm{m}}{I_\mathrm{D}} = \frac{1}{n V_\mathrm{T}}
}\end{equation} for a MOSFET in weak inversion (i.e., small gate-source
voltage). \(n\) is the subthreshold slope, and
\(V_\mathrm{T} = k T / q\) which is \(25.8\,\text{mV}\) at
\(300\,\text{K}\). We thus have \(n \approx 1.38\) for this LV NMOS,
which falls nicely into the usual range for \(n\) of \(1.3\) to \(1.5\)
for bulk CMOS (FinFET have \(n\) very close to \(1\)).

For the classical square-law model of the MOSFET in strong inversion,
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) is given as
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-gmid-stronginversion}{
\frac{g_\mathrm{m}}{I_\mathrm{D}} = \frac{2}{V_\mathrm{GS}- V_\mathrm{th}} = \frac{2}{V_\mathrm{od}} 
}\end{equation} with \(V_\mathrm{th}\) the threshold voltage and
\(V_\mathrm{od}\) the so-called ``overdrive voltage.''

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

Why are we so often using \(300\,\text{K}\) for a typical condition? As
this corresponds to roughly \(27^{\circ}\text{C}\), this accounts for
some self heating compared to otherwise usual room temperatures.
Further, engineers like round numbers which are easy to remember, so
\(300\,\text{K}\) is used as a proxy for room temperature.

\end{tcolorbox}

As we can also see from belows plot, the peak transit frequency of the
LV NMOS is about \(75\,\text{GHz}\), which allows building
radio-frequency circuits up to ca.
\(f_\mathrm{T} / 10 = 7.5\,\text{GHz}\), which is a respectible number.
It is no coincidence, that the transition for RF design in the GHz-range
switched from BJT-based technologies to CMOS roughly in the timeframe
when 130nm CMOS became available (ca. 2000).

The following figure plots \(f_\mathrm{T}\) against
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) for several different \(L\). As you can
see, device speeds maximizes for a low \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and
a short \(L\). As you can see the drain-source voltage is kept at
\(V_\mathrm{DS}= 0.75\,\text{V} = V_\mathrm{DD}/ 2\), which is a typical
value keeping the MOSFET in saturation across the characterization
sweeps. Further, the source-bulk voltage is kept at
\(V_\mathrm{SB} = 0\,\text{V}\), which means bulk and source terminals
are connected.

The next plot shows the ratio of \(g_\mathrm{m}/ g_\mathrm{ds}\) versus
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\). The ratio \(g_\mathrm{m}/ g_\mathrm{ds}\)
is the so-called \textbf{``self-gain''} of the MOSFET, and shows the
maximum voltage gain we can achieve in a single transistor
configuration. As one can see the self gain increases for increasing
\(L\), but this also gives a slower transistor, so again there is a
trade-off. This plot allows us to select the proper \(L\) of a MOSFET if
we know which amount of self gain we need.

The following figure plots the drain current density \(I_\mathrm{D}/W\)
as a function of \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and \(L\). With this plot
we can find out how to set the \(W\) of a MOSFET once we know the
biasing current \(I_\mathrm{D}\), the \(L\) (selected according to self
gain, \(f_\mathrm{T}\), and other considerations) and the
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) design point we selected. The drain
current density \(I_\mathrm{D}/W\) is a very useful nomalized metric to
use, because the physical action in the MOSFET establishes a charge
density in the channel below the gate, and the changing of the \(W\) of
the device merely transforms this charge density into an absolute
parameter (together with \(L\)).

The following plot shows the minimum drain-source voltage
\(V_\mathrm{ds,sat}\) that we need to establish in order to keep the
MOSFET in saturation. As you can see, this value is almost independent
of \(L\), and increases for small \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\). So for
low-voltage circuits, where headroom is precious, we tend to bias at
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\ge 10\), wheres for fast circuits we need to
go to small \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\le 5\) requiring substantial
voltage headroom per MOSFET stage that we stack on top of each other.

For analog circuits the noise performance is usually quite important.
Thermal noise of a resistor (the Johnson-Nyquist noise) has a flat
power-spectral density (PSD) given by
\(\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}/\Delta f = 4 k T R\), where \(k\) is
Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) absolute temperature, and \(R\) the value of
the resistor (the unit of \(\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}/\Delta f\) is
\(\text{V}^2/\text{Hz}\)). This PSD is essentially flat until very high
frequencies where
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson–Nyquist_noise}{quantum
effects} start to kick in.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

We usually leave the \(\Delta f\) away for a shorter notation, so we
write \(\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}\) when we actually mean
\(\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}/\Delta f\).

Please also note that the pair of \(k T\) pretty much always shows up
together, so when you do a calculation and you miss the one or the
other, that is often a sign for miscalculation.

Further, when working with PSD there is the usage of a one-sided (\(f\)
runs from \(0\) to \(\infty\)) or two-sided PSD (\(f\) runs from
\(-\infty\) to \(\infty\)). The default in this lecture is the usage of
a \textbf{one-sided PSD}.

\end{tcolorbox}

In this lecture the only MOSFET noise we consider is the drain noise,
showing up as a current noise between drain and source, and given by
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-noise}{
\overline{I_\mathrm{d,n}^2} = 4 k T \gamma g_\mathrm{d0}
}\end{equation} In saturation (the MOSFET operating as a current
source), \(g_\mathrm{d0} = g_\mathrm{m}\), whereas in triode (the MOSFET
operating as a switch), \(g_\mathrm{d0} = g_\mathrm{ds}\).

The factor \(\gamma\) is a function of many things (in classical theory,
\(\gamma = 2/3\) in saturation and \(\gamma = 1\) in triode), and it is
characterized in the following plot as a function of
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and \(L\). So when calculating MOSFET
noise we can lookup \(\gamma\) in the below plot, and use
Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-noise} to calculate the effective drain current
noise.

\includegraphics{index_files/figure-latex/.-sizing-techsweep_sg13_plots_nmos-cell-13-output-1.png}

In a MOSFET, unfortunately, besides the thermal noise according to
Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-noise}, there is also a substantial
low-frequency excess noise, called ``flicker noise'' due to its
characteristic \(\overline{I_\mathrm{d,nf}^2} = K_\mathrm{f}/f\)
behaviour (this means that this noise PSD decreases versus frequency).
In order to characterize this flicker noise the following plot shows the
cross-over frequency \(f_\mathrm{co}\), where the flicker noise is as
large as the thermal noise. As can be seen in the below plot, this
frequency is a strong function of \(L\) and
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\). Generally, the flicker noise is
proportional to \((W L)^{-1}\), so the larger the device is, the lower
the flicker noise. The parameter \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) largely
stays constant when we keep \(W/L\) constant, so for a given
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) flicker noise is proportinal to \(1/L^2\).
However, increasing \(L\) lowers device speed dramatically, so here we
have a trade-off between flicker-noise performance and MOSFET speed, and
this can have dramatic consequences for high-speed circuits.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

The physical origin of flicker noise is the crystal interface between
silicon (Si) and the silicondioxide (SiO\textsubscript{2}). Since these
are different materials, there are dangling bonds, which can capture
charge charriers travelling in the channel. After a random time, these
carriers are released, and flicker noise is the result. The amount of
flicker noise is a function of the manufacturing process, and will
generally be different between device types and wafer foundries.

\end{tcolorbox}

As you can see in the following plot, \(f_\mathrm{co}\) can reach well
into the 10's of MHz for short MOSFETs, significantly degrading the
noise performance of a circuit.

In the following, we have the same plots as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec-techsweep-nmos}, but now for the PMOS.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

In all PMOS plots we plot positive values for voltages and currents, to
have compatible plots to the NMOS. Of course, in a PMOS, voltages and
currents have different polarity compared to the NMOS.

\end{tcolorbox}

\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and \(f_\mathrm{T}\) versus the
gate-source voltage \(V_\mathrm{GS}\):

\(f_\mathrm{T}\) against \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) for several
different \(L\). One can see significantly lower top speed for the PMOS
compared to the NMOS, which means for high-speed circuits the NMOS
should be used.

\(g_\mathrm{m}/ g_\mathrm{ds}\) versus \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\).
Unfortunately, one can see a modelling error for the PMOS in this plot.
The self gain \(g_\mathrm{m}/ g_\mathrm{ds}\) reaches non-physical
values, which indicates an issue with the \(g_\mathrm{ds}\) modelling
for the PMOS. We can not use these values for our circuit sizing, so we
will use the respective NMOS plots also for the PMOS.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white]

This example shows how important it is to benchmark the device models
when starting to use a new technology. Modelling artifacts like the one
shown are quite often happening, as setting up the device compact models
and parametrizing them according to measurement data is a very complex
task. In any case, just be aware that modelling issues could exist in
whatever PDK you are using!

Flicker noise corner frequency \(f_\mathrm{co}\) versus
\(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) and \(L\). If you compare this figure
carefully with the NMOS figure you can see that for some operating
points the flicker noise for the PMOS is lower than for the NMOS. This
is often true for CMOS technologies, so it can be an advantage to use a
PMOS transistor in places where flicker noise is critical, like an OTA
input stage. Using PMOS has the further advantage that the bulk node can
be tied to source (which for NMOS is only possible in a triple-well
technology, which is often not available), which gets rid of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_voltage}{body effect}.

\subsection{First Circuit: MOSFET Diode}\label{sec-mosfet-diode}

The first (simple) circuit we will investigate is a MOSFET, where the
gate is shorted with a drain, a so-called MOSFET ``diode'', which is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode}. This diode is one half of a
current mirror, which we will investigate in a future section.

Why looking at a single-transistor circuit at all? By starting with the
simplest possible circuit we can develop important skills in circuit
analysis (setting up and calculating a small-signal model, calculating
open-loop gain, calculate noise) and Xschem/ngspice simulation testbench
creation. We safely assume that also the Mona Lisa was not Leonardo da
Vinci's first painting, so let's start slow.

This diode is usually biased by a current source, shown as
\(I_\mathrm{bias}\) in the figure. Depending on MOSFET sizing with \(W\)
and \(L\), a certain gate-source voltage \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) will develop.
This voltage can be used as a biasing voltage for other circuit parts,
for example.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

It is important to realize that this configuration essentially employs a
feedback loop for operation. The voltage at the drain of the MOSFET is
sensed by the gate, and the gate voltage changes until the
\(I_\mathrm{D}\) is exactly equal to \(I_\mathrm{bias}\). In this sense
this is probably the smallest feedback circuit one can build.

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{MOSFET Diode Sizing}\label{mosfet-diode-sizing}

We will now build this circuit in Xschem. For sizing the MOSFET we will
use the \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\) methodology introduced in
Section~\ref{sec-gmid-method}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Exercise}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white]

Please build a MOSFET diode circuit in Xschem where you use an LV NMOS,
set \(I_\mathrm{bias} = 20\,\mu\text{A}\), \(L = 0.13\,\mu\text{m}\),
and we want to use \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}= 10\) (often a suitable
compromise between transistor speed and \(g_\mathrm{m}\) efficiency).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the figures in Section~\ref{sec-techsweep-nmos} to find out the
  proper value for \(W\).
\item
  What is \(f_\mathrm{T}\) for this MOSFET? What is the value for
  \(g_\mathrm{m}\) and \(g_\mathrm{ds}\)?
\item
  Draw the circuit in Xschem, and simulate the operating point. Do the
  values match to the values found out before during circuit sizing?
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

Before continuing, please finish the previous exercise. Once you are
done, compare with the below provided solution.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Solution}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the fact that
  \(I_\mathrm{bias} = I_\mathrm{D} = 20\,\mu\text{A}\) and
  \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}= 10\) directly provides
  \(g_\mathrm{m}= 0.2\,\text{mS}\).
\item
  Using the self-gain plot, we see that
  \(g_\mathrm{m}/g_\mathrm{ds}\approx 21\), so
  \(g_\mathrm{ds}\approx 9.5\,\mu\text{S}\). The \(f_\mathrm{T}\) can
  easily be found in the respective plot to be
  \(f_\mathrm{T} = 23\,\text{GHz}\).
\item
  The \(W\) of the MOSFET we find using the drain current density plot
  and the given bias current. Rounding to half-microns results in
  \(W = 1\,\mu\text{m}\).
\item
  Since we are looking at the graphs, we further find \(\gamma = 0.84\),
  \(V_\mathrm{ds,sat} = 0.18\,\text{V}\), and
  \(f_\mathrm{co} \approx 15\,\text{MHz}\).
\item
  In addition, we expect \(V_\mathrm{GS}\approx 0.6\,\text{V}\).
\end{enumerate}

An example Jupyter notebook to extract these values accurately you can
find \href{./sizing/sizing_mosfet_diode.ipynb}{here}. An Xschem
schematic for this exercise is provide
\href{./xschem/mosfet_diode_sizing.sch}{as well}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{MOSFET Diode Large-Signal
Behaviour}\label{mosfet-diode-large-signal-behaviour}

As discussed above, the MOSFET diode configuration is essentially a
feedback loop. Before we will analyse this loop in small-signal, we want
to investgate how this loop settles in the time domain, and by doing
this we can observe the large-signal settling behaviour. To simulate
this, we change the dc bias source from the previous example to a
transient current source, which we will turn on after some ns. The
resulting Xschem testbench is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-settling-tb}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{./xschem/mosfet_diode_settling.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-mosfet-diode-settling-tb}Testbench for MOSFET diode
transient settling.}

\end{figure}%

In Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-settling-tb} another interesting effect
can be observed: While the turn-on happens quite rapidly (essentially
the bias current source charges the gate capacitance, until the
gate-source voltage is large enough that the drain current counteracts
the bias current), the turn-off shows a very long settling tail. This is
due to the fact that as the gate capacitance is discharged by the drain
current the \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) drops, which in turn reduces the drain
current, which will make the discharge even slower. We have an effect
similar to the capacitor discharge by a diode (Hellen 2003).

It is thus generally a good idea to add power-down switches to the
circuits to disable the circuit quickly by pulling floating nodes to a
defined potential (usually \(V_\mathrm{DD}\) or \(V_\mathrm{SS}\)) and
to avoid long intermediate states during power down. This will also
allow a turn-on from a well-defined off-state.

\subsubsection{MOSFET Diode Small-Signal
Analysis}\label{mosfet-diode-small-signal-analysis}

We now want to investigate the small-signal behaviour of the MOSFET
diode. Based on the small-signal model of the MOSFET in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-small-signal-model} we realize that gate and
drain are shorted, and we also connect bulk to source. We can thus
simplify the circit to the one shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-small-signal}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

For small-signal analysis we would not need to declare one node as the
ground potential. However, when doing so, and selecting the ground node
strategically, we can simplify the analysis, as we usually do not
formulate KCL for the ground node (as we have only \(N-1\) independent
KCL equations, \(N\) being the number of nodes of a circuit), and the
potential difference equations are simpler if one node is at \(0\,V\).

\end{tcolorbox}

For calculating the small-signal impedance of the MOSFET diode we
formulate KCL at the top node to get \[
i_\mathrm{bias} - s C_\mathrm{gs}v_\mathrm{gs}- g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{gs}- g_\mathrm{ds}v_\mathrm{gs}= 0.
\]

It follows that
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-diode-impedance}{
Z_\mathrm{diode}(s) = \frac{v_\mathrm{gs}}{i_\mathrm{bias}} = \frac{1}{g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{ds}+ s C_\mathrm{gs}}.
}\end{equation}

When neglecting \(g_\mathrm{ds}\) and at dc we get
\(Z_\mathrm{diode} = 1 / g_\mathrm{m}\), which is an important result
and should be memorized.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white]

In circuit analysis it is often algebraically easier to work with
conductances instead of impedances, so please remember that Ohm's law
for a conductance is \(I = G V\), and for a capacitance is
\(I = s C V\). When writing equations, it is also practical to keep
\(s C\) together, so we will strive to sort terms accordingly.

\end{tcolorbox}

Looking at Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-impedance} we see that for low
frequencies, the diode impedance is resistive, and for high frequencies
it becomes capactive as the gate-source capacitance starts to dominate.
The corner frequeny of this low-pass can be calculated as \[
\omega_\mathrm{c} = \frac{g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{ds}}{C_\mathrm{gs}} \approx \omega_\mathrm{T}
\] which is pretty much the transit frequency of the MOSFET!

\subsubsection{MOSFET Diode Stability
Analysis}\label{mosfet-diode-stability-analysis}

The diode-connected MOSFET forms a feedback loop. What is the open-loop
gain? For calculating it, we are breaking the loop, and apply a dummy
\(C_\mathrm{gs}^{*}\) at the right side to keep the impedances correct.
A circuit diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-openloop}, we
break the loop at the dotted connection. As we can see in this example,
it is critically important when breaking up a loop for analysis (also
for simulation!) to keep the terminal impedances the same. Only in
special cases where the load impedance is very high or the driving
impedance is very low is it acceptable to disregard loading effects!

\textsubscript{Source:

\textsubscript{Source:

By inspecting Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-openloop} we see that \[
v_\mathrm{out} = - g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{in} \frac{1}{g_\mathrm{ds}+ s C_\mathrm{gs}}.
\]

The open-loop gain \(H_\mathrm{ol}(s)\) is thus
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-diode-openloop-gain}{
H_\mathrm{ol}(s) = \frac{v_\mathrm{out}}{v_\mathrm{in}} = -\frac{g_\mathrm{m}}{g_\mathrm{ds}+ s C_\mathrm{gs}}.
}\end{equation}

Inspecting Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-openloop-gain} we realize that

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the dc gain \(g_\mathrm{m}/ g_\mathrm{ds}\) is the self-gain of the
  MOSFET, so
  \(20 \log(0.2 \cdot 10^{-3} / 9.6 \cdot 10 ^{-6}) = 26.4\,\text{dB}\),
  and
\item
  there is a pole at
  \(\omega_\mathrm{p} = -g_\mathrm{ds}/ C_\mathrm{gs}\), which is at
  \(9.6 \cdot 10 ^{-6} / (2 \pi \cdot 1.4 \cdot 10^{-15}) = 1.1\,\text{GHz}\).
\end{enumerate}

With this single pole location in \(H_\mathrm{ol}(s)\) this loop is
perfectly stable at under all conditions.

The question is now how to simulate this open-loop gain, and how to
break the loop open in simulation? In general there are various methods,
as we can use artificially large (ideal) inductors and capacitors to
break loops open and still establish the correct dc operating points for
the ac loop analysis. However, mimicking the correct loading can be an
issue, and requires a lot of careful consideration.

There is an alternative method which breaks the loop open only by adding
an ac voltage source in series (thus keeps the dc operating point
intact), or injects current using a current source. Based on both
measurements the open-loop gain can be calculated. This is called
\textbf{Middlebrook's method} (Middlebrook 1975) which is based on
double injection, and we will use it for our loop simulations. This
method is detailed in \textbf{?@sec-middlebrook-method}.

We now want to simulate the open-loop transfer function
\(H_\mathrm{ol}(s)\) by using Middlebrook's method and confirm our
analysis above.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Exercise}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white]

Please build a simulation testbench in Xschem to simulate the open-loop
transfer function of the MOSFET diode. Confirm the dc gain and pole
location as given by Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-openloop-gain}.

If you are getting stuck you can look at this Xschem
\href{./xschem/mosfet_diode_loopgain.sch}{testbench}, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-loopgain-tb}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\centering{

\includegraphics{./xschem/mosfet_diode_loopgain.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-mosfet-diode-loopgain-tb}Testbench for MOSFET diode
stability analysis.}

\end{figure}%

\end{tcolorbox}

From simulation we see that the open-loop gain is \(24.9\,\text{dB}\) at
low frequencies, which matches quite well our prediction of
\(26.4\,\text{dB}\). In the Bode plot we see a low-pass with a
\(-3\,\text{dB}\) corner frequency of \(1.4\,\text{GHz}\), which again
is fairly close to our prediction of \(1.1\,\text{GHz}\).

\subsubsection{MOSFET Diode Noise
Calculation}\label{mosfet-diode-noise-calculation}

As a final exercise on the MOSFET diode circuit we want to calculate the
output noise when we consider \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) the output reference
voltage which is created when passing a bias current through the MOSFET
diode. The bias current we will assume noiseless.

We will use the small-signal circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-mosfet-diode-small-signal-w-noise}.

\textsubscript{Source:

small-signal model with drain noise source.}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

As we have already calculated the small-signal diode impedance in
Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-impedance} we will use this result, and
just note that the drain current noise of the MOSFET flows through this
impedance. The noise voltage at \(v_\mathrm{gs}\) is thus given as \[
\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2} = Z_\mathrm{diode}^2 \overline{I_\mathrm{n,d}^2}.
\]

The drain current noise of the MOSFET is given as (introduced in
Section~\ref{sec-mosfet-smallsignal-model}) \[
\overline{I_\mathrm{n,d}^2} = 4 k T \gamma g_\mathrm{m}.
\]

For low frequencies (ignoring \(g_\mathrm{ds}\) and \(C_\mathrm{gs}\))
we get \[
\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2} = Z_\mathrm{diode}^2 \overline{I_\mathrm{n,d}^2} = \frac{1}{g_\mathrm{m}^2} 4 k T \gamma g_\mathrm{m}= \frac{4 k T \gamma}{g_\mathrm{m}}
\] which is the thermal noise of a resistor of value
\(1 / g_\mathrm{m}\) enhanced by the factor \(\gamma\).

We now calculate the full equation, and after a bit of algebra arrive at
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-psd}{
\overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}(f) = \frac{4 k T \gamma g_\mathrm{m}}{(g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{ds})^2 + (2 \pi f C_\mathrm{gs})^2}.
}\end{equation}

If we are interested in the PSD of the noise then
Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-psd} gives us the result. If we are
interested in the rms value (the total noise) we need to integrate this
equation, using the following identity:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Useful Integral for Noise Calculations}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white]

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-integral-identity}{
\int_0^\infty {\frac{a}{b^2 + c^2 f^2} df} = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{a}{b \cdot c}
}\end{equation}

\end{tcolorbox}

Using the integral help in Equation~\ref{eq-integral-identity}, we can
easily transform Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-psd} to
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-rms}{
V_\mathrm{n,rms}^2 = \int_0^\infty \overline{V_\mathrm{n}^2}(f) df = \frac{k T \gamma g_\mathrm{m}}{(g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{ds}) C_\mathrm{gs}}.
}\end{equation}

The form of Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-rms} is the exact
solution, but we gain additional insight if we assume that
\(g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{ds}\approx g_\mathrm{m}\) and then
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-rms-simplified}{
V_\mathrm{n,rms}^2 = \frac{k T \gamma}{C_\mathrm{gs}}.
}\end{equation}

Inspecting Equation~\ref{eq-mosfet-diode-noise-rms-simplified} we see
our familiar \(kT/C\) noise enhanced by the factor \(\gamma\)!
Calculating this value for our MOSFET diode we get
\(\sqrt{V_\mathrm{n,rms}^2} = \sqrt{1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} \cdot 300 \cdot 0.84 / 1.4 \cdot 10^{-15}} = 1.58\,\text{mV}\),
which is a sizeable value! We run circuits in this technology at
\(V_\mathrm{DD}= 1.5\,\mathrm{V}\), which leaves us with a signal swing

the flicker noise in the PSD? How much is its contribution to the rms

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}

In this section we investigated the simple MOSFET-diode circuit. We
learned important skills like how to derive a small-signal model, how to
calculate important features like noise and open-loop gain for stability
analysis. We introduced Middlebrook's method to have a mechanism to open
up loops in simulation (and calculation) without disturbing operating
points for change loading conditions.

If you feel that you have not yet mastered these topics or are uncertain
in the operation of ngspice, please go back to the beginning of the
section and read through the theory and redo the exercises.

\subsection{Current Mirror}\label{sec-current-mirror}

In this section we will look into a fundamental building block which is
often used in integrated circuit design, the \textbf{current mirror}. A
diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig-current-mirror} with one MOSFET
diode converting the incoming bias current into a voltage, and two
output MOSFETs working as current sources, which are biased from the
diode. By properly selecting all \(W\) and \(L\) the input current can
be scaled, and multiple copies can be created atn once. Shown in the
figure are two output currents, but any number of parallel branches can
be realized.

branches.}

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

The output current \(I_\mathrm{out1}\) is then given by \[
I_\mathrm{out1} = I_\mathrm{bias} \frac{W_2}{L_2} \frac{L_1}{W_1}
\] and the output current \(I_\mathrm{out2}\) is given by \[
I_\mathrm{out2} = I_\mathrm{bias} \frac{W_3}{L_3} \frac{L_1}{W_1}.
\]

For good matching in layout care has to be taken that the MOSFET widths
and lengths are constructed out of \textbf{unit elements} of identical
size, where an appropiate amount of these single units are then arranged
in series or parallel configuration to arrive at the target \(W\) and
\(L\).

As we know from earlier investigations of the MOSFET performance in
Section~\ref{sec-gmid-method} the drain current of a MOSFET is a
function of \(V_\mathrm{GS}\) and \(V_\mathrm{DS}\). As long as the
MOSFET stays in saturation (i.e., \(V_\mathrm{DS}> V_\mathrm{ds,dsat}\))
the drain current is just a mild function of \(V_\mathrm{DS}\)
(essentially the effect of \(g_\mathrm{ds}\), which is the output
conductance of the MOSFET). A fundamental flaw of the basic current
mirror shown in Figure~\ref{fig-current-mirror} is the mismatch of the
\(V_\mathrm{DS}\) of the MOSFET. The input-side diode has
\(V_\mathrm{GS}= V_\mathrm{DS}\), whereas the output current sources
have a \(V_\mathrm{DS}\) depending on the connected circuitry. Improved
current mirrors exist (basically fixing this flaw), still, when just a
simple current mirror is required this structure is used for its
simplicity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, bottomtitle=1mm, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Exercise}, arc=.35mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white]

Please construct a current mirror based on the MOSFET-diode which we
sized in Section~\ref{sec-mosfet-diode}. The input current
\(I_\mathrm{bias} = 20\,\mu\text{A}\), and we want three output currents
of size \(10\,\mu\text{A}\), \(20\,\mu\text{A}\), and
\(40\,\mu\text{A}\).

Sweep the output voltage of all three current branches and see over
which voltage range an acceptable current is created. For which output
voltage range is the current departing from its ideal value, and why?

You see that the slope of the output current is quite bad, as
\(g_\mathrm{ds}\) is too large. We can improve this by changing the
length to \(L = 5\,\mu\text{m}\) (for motivation, please look at the
graphs in Section~\ref{sec-gmid-method}). In addition, for a current
mirror we are not interested in a high \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}\)
value, so we can use \(g_\mathrm{m}/I_\mathrm{D}= 5\) in this case.
Please size the current mirror MOSFETs accordinly (please round the
\(W\) to half micron, to keep sizes a bit more practical). Compare this
result to the previous one, what changed?

In case you get stuck, here are Xschem schematics for the
\href{./xschem/current_mirror.sch}{original} and the
\href{./xschem/current_mirror_improved.sch}{improved} current mirrors.

\subsection{Differential Pair}\label{sec-diff-pair}

Like the current mirror in Section~\ref{sec-current-mirror} the
\textbf{differential pair} is an ubiquitous building block often used in
integrated circuit design. The fundamental structure is given in
Figure~\ref{fig-differential-pair}.

\textsubscript{Source:

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:

Notebook}}

In order to understand its operation it is instructive to separate the
input condition into (1) a purely differential voltage, and (2) into a
common-mode voltage, and see what the impact on the output currents is.

\subsubsection{Differential Operation of the
Diffpair}\label{differential-operation-of-the-diffpair}

For a differential mode of operation we assume that the input common
mode voltage is constant,
i.e.~\(V_\mathrm{in,p} + V_\mathrm{in,n} = V_\mathrm{CM}\). A
differential input voltage \(v_\mathrm{in}\) then results in \[
V_\mathrm{in,p} = V_\mathrm{CM} + \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2}
\] and \[
V_\mathrm{in,n} = V_\mathrm{CM} - \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2}.
\]

For a small-signal differential drive the potential at the tail point
stays constant and we can treat it as a virtual ground. The output
current on each side is then given by (neglecting \(g_\mathrm{ds}\) and
\(g_\mathrm{mb}\) of \(M_1\) and \(M_2\)) \[
i_\mathrm{out,p} = g_\mathrm{m1} \left( \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2} \right)
\] and \[
i_\mathrm{out,n} = g_\mathrm{m2} \left( -\frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{2} \right).
\]

Usually we assume symmetry in the differential pair, so
\(g_\mathrm{m1} = g_\mathrm{m2} = g_\mathrm{m}\). The differential
output current \(i_\mathrm{out}\) is then given by
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-differential-pair-dm}{
i_\mathrm{out} = i_\mathrm{out,p} - i_\mathrm{out,n} = g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{in}
}\end{equation}

We see in Equation~\ref{eq-differential-pair-dm} that the differential
output current is simply the differential input voltage multiplied by
the \(g_\mathrm{m}\) of the individual transistor. We also note that the
bottom conductance \(g_\mathrm{tail}\) plays no role for the
small-signal differential operation.

\subsubsection{Common-Mode Operation of the
Diffpair}\label{common-mode-operation-of-the-diffpair}

Usually, the source conductance \(g_\mathrm{tail}\) is realized by a
current source and ideally should be \(g_\mathrm{tail} = 0\). If this is
the case, then the output currents are not a function of the common-mode
input voltage, and (\(I_\mathrm{tail}\) is set by the tail current
source) \[
I_\mathrm{out,p} = I_\mathrm{out,n} = \frac{I_\mathrm{tail}}{2}.
\]

However, if we assume a realistic tail current source then
\(g_\mathrm{tail} > 0\). For analysis we can simply look at a half
circuit since everything is symmetric. In order to simplify the analysis
a bit we remove all capacitors from the MOSFET small-signal model and
set \(g_\mathrm{ds}= g_\mathrm{mb}= 0\). We arrive then at the
small-signal equivalent circuit shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-differential-pair-cm} (note that we set
\(v_\mathrm{in,p} = v_\mathrm{in,n} = v_\mathrm{in}\) and
\(i_\mathrm{out,p} = i_\mathrm{out,n} = i_\mathrm{out}\) under symmetry
considerations).

\textsubscript{Source:

Formulating KVL for the input-side loop we get \[
v_\mathrm{in} = v_\mathrm{gs}+ \frac{i_\mathrm{ds}}{g_\mathrm{tail}}.
\]

With \(i_\mathrm{out} = i_\mathrm{ds}= g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{gs}\) we
arrive at
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-differential-pair-cm}{
i_\mathrm{out} = \frac{g_\mathrm{m}g_\mathrm{tail}}{g_\mathrm{m}+ g_\mathrm{tail}} v_\mathrm{in}
}\end{equation}

Interpreting Equation~\ref{eq-differential-pair-cm} we can distinguish
the following extreme cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(g_\mathrm{tail} = 0\) (ideal tail current source) then
  \(i_\mathrm{out} = 0\), the common-mode voltage variation from the
  input is suppressed and does not show up at the common-mode output
  current (which is constant due to the ideal tail current source). This
  is usually the case that we want to achieve.
\item
  If \(g_\mathrm{tail} = \infty\) then
  \(i_\mathrm{out} = g_\mathrm{m}v_\mathrm{in}\), which means the output
  current is a function of the MOSFET \(g_\mathrm{m}\). If everything is
  perfectly matched, then the differential output current is zero, but
  the common-mode output current changes according to the common-mode
  input voltage. In special cases this can be a wanted behaviour, this
  configuration is called a ``pseudo-differential pair.''
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A Basic 5-Transistor OTA}\label{sec-basic-ota}

Suited with the knowledge of basic transitor operation
(Section~\ref{sec-first-steps} and Section~\ref{sec-gmid-method}) and
the working knowledge of the current mirror
(Section~\ref{sec-mosfet-diode} and Section~\ref{sec-current-mirror}) as
well as the differential pair (Section~\ref{sec-diff-pair}) we can now
start to design our first real circuit. A fundamental (simple) circuit
that is often used for basic tasks is the 5-transistor operational
transconductance amplifier (OTA). A circuit diagram of this 5T-OTA is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-basic-ota}.

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-basic-ota}The 5-transistor OTA.}

\end{figure}%

\textsubscript{Source:
\href{https://iic-jku.github.io/analog-circuit-design/index.qmd.html}{Article
Notebook}}

The operation is as follows: \(M_{1,2}\) form a differential pair which
is biased by the current source \(M_6\). \(M_{5,6}\) form a current
mirror, thus the input bias current \(I_\mathrm{bias}\) sets the bias
current in the OTA. The differential pair \(M_{1,2}\) is loaded by the
current mirror \(M_{3,4}\) which mirrors the output current of \(M_1\)
to the right side. Here, the currents from \(M_4\) and \(M_2\) are
summed, and together with the conductance effective at the output node a
voltage builds up.

As this is an OTA the output is a current; if the load impedance is high
(i.e., purely capacitive) then the voltage gain of the OTA can be high
(of course, in this simple OTA it is limited). With a high-impedance
loading this OTA can provide a voltage output, and this is actually how
OTAs are mostly operated.

\subsubsection{Voltage Buffer with OTA}\label{voltage-buffer-with-ota}

In order to design an OTA we need an application, and from this we need
to derive the circuit specifications. We want to use this OTA to realize
a voltage buffer which lighly loads a voltage source and can drive a
large capacitive load. Such a configuration is often used to, e.g.,
buffer a reference voltage that is needed (and thus loaded) by another
circuit. The block diagram of this configuration is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-voltage-buffer-ota}.

If the voltage gain of the OTA is Figure~\ref{fig-voltage-buffer-ota} is
high, then \(V_\mathrm{out} \approx V_\mathrm{in}\). We now want to
design an OTA for this application for the following spefication values
(see Table~\ref{tbl-voltage-buffer-spec}).

\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Large-Signal Analysis of the
OTA}\label{large-signal-analysis-of-the-ota}

The first step when receiving a design task is to look at the
specifications, and see whether they make sense. Detailed performance of
the design will be the result of the circuit simulation, but before we
step into sizing we need to do a few simple calculations to (a) allows
to do back-of-the-envelope gauging if the specification makes sense, and
(b) the derived analytical equations will serve as guide for the sizing
procedure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In terms of large-signal operation, we will now check whether the
  input and output voltage range, as well as the settling time can be
  roughly met.
\item
  When the input is at its maximum of \(1.3\,\text{V}\), we see that we
  need to keep \(M_1\) in saturation. We can calculate that
  \(V_\mathrm{DS1} = V_\mathrm{DD}- V_\mathrm{GS3} + V_\mathrm{GS1} - V_\mathrm{in} = 1.45 - 0.6 + 0.6 - 1.3 = 0.15\,\text{V}\),
  which barely leaves enough margin, so we must keep the gate-source
  voltages of \(M_1\) and \(M_3\) resonably small.
\item
  When the input is at its minimum of \(1.1\,\text{V}\), we see that the
  \(V_\mathrm{DS}\) of \(M_6\) is calculated as
  \(V_\mathrm{DS6} = V_\mathrm{in} - V_\mathrm{GS1} = 1.1 - 0.6 = 0.5\,\text{V}\),
  so this leaves plenty of margin.
\item
  For the output voltage, when the output voltage is on the high side,
  it leaves
  \(V_\mathrm{DS4} = V_\mathrm{DD}- V_\mathrm{out} = 1.45 - 1.3 = 0.15\,\text{V}\),
  whis is on the edge.
\item
  When the output voltage is on the low side, it leaves
  \(V_\mathrm{DS2} = V_\mathrm{out} - V_\mathrm{in} + V_\mathrm{GS2} = 1.3 - 1.55 + 0.6 = 0.35\,\text{V}\),
  so this should work.
\end{itemize}

In summary, we think that we can make an NMOS-input OTA like the one in
Figure~\ref{fig-basic-ota} work for the required supply and input- and
output voltages. If this would not work out, we need to look for further
options, like a PMOS-input OTA, or a NMOS/PMOS-input OTA.

Another large-signal specification item that we can quickly check is the
settling time. Under slewing conditions, we complete bias current in the
OTA is steered towards the output (try to understand why this is the
case), so when the output capacitor is fully discharged, and we assume
just a linear ramp due to constant-current charging of the output
capacitor, the settling time is \[
T_\mathrm{slew} \approx \frac{C_\mathrm{load} V_\mathrm{out}}{I_\mathrm{tail}} = \frac{50 \cdot 10^{-15} \cdot 1.3}{100 \cdot 10^{-6}} = 0.65\,\text{ns}
\] so this leaves plenty of margin for additional slow-signal settling
due to the limited bandwidth, as well as reducing the supply current.

The small-signal settling (assuming one pole at the bandwidth corner
frequency) leads to an approximate settling time (1\% error corresponds
to \(\approx 5 \tau\)) of \[
T_\mathrm{slew} \approx \frac{5}{2 \pi f_\mathrm{c}} = \frac{5}{2 \pi \cdot 1 \cdot 10^{-6}} = 0.8\,\mu\text{s}.
\] which also checks out.
